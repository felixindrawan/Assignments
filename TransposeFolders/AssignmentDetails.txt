Automates the process of organizing files. 
==============
This shell script takes 2 command line arguments (assuming they're directory names),
a source directory name, and the target directory name. The script doesn't run
if user gives less than 2 arguments.

The target directory will be removed recursively if it exist, and and a new
directory will be created with the files switched. For example,

src/2017/A08
src/2018/A31
src/2018/A67
src/2019/A22 

will be transposed to

tgt/A08/2017
tgt/A31/2018
tgt/A67/2018
tgt/A22/2019

Assume:
- src exist, and there are two levels of directories under src.
- Directory names doesn't start with dots
- src != tgt
